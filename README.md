# Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence. It involves the use of neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. Deep learning algorithms are particularly effective for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.

In this repository I've done a project on CNN Classification, which are primarily used for image and video recognition. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. CNNs use convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
